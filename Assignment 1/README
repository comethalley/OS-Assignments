The shell code mimics:

3 builtin commands
1.cd
2.pwd
3.echo

& most system commands with/without arguments.(ls, ls -lah, emacs etc)

After going into the directory do the following:

gcc shell.c
./a.out

CTRL+C exits from the shell. 


Pinfo,psinfo & Background feature have been implemented(BONUS).
